# 06 Debugging

## Concept
- Offline source reading vs live debugging
- Debugger, tools
- Executable with symbols (vs production optimized)
- `launch.json`
- breakpoint, halted execution

## Demo
- prepping breakpoint
- launching
- breaking
- state of debugging
  - halted
  - running
    - running, executing
    - waiting for user input
- state of app
  - execution path
  - memory
- stepping
  - over
  - in
  - out
  - continue
- rinse and repeat
  - sometimes may have to relaunch
  - sometimes may have to reset data
- stopping

## Unit testing
- testable code
- tests: `test/test.cpp`

## namespaces
- address analogy: `Ohio > Columbus` vs `Indiana > Columbus`
